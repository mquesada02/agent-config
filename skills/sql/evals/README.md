# Eval run procedure

The model evals of the `sql` skill run by hand with `claude plugin eval`. They cost tokens, so they run only when you choose. They are not part of the repo test command (the declared command in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` runs the unit tests only).

## Layout

- One folder per case: `evals/<case>/` with `prompt.md` (or `case.yaml`) and `graders/*.md`.
- Fixture repos live inside the case folder.
- Results go to `evals/results/<timestamp>/`. The folder is ignored by git.
- The target is the bare skill folder: `skills/sql`. No wrapper manifest and no `--eval-dir` are needed (answer to open question 1 on the general spec).

## Run

Run from the repo root. Every run uses `--no-publish`, `-j 2` (the CPU rule), `--runs 3` and `--threshold 1.0`.

A case that needs no database and no temp service files:

```
claude plugin eval skills/sql --no-publish -j 2 --runs 3 --threshold 1.0 --ablation none --allow-tools Bash
```

A case that needs the database or the temp service files adds `--scaffold`, because a case's `scaffold_script` runs only with that flag, and `--allow-tools Bash`, because Bash is a gated tool:

```
claude plugin eval skills/sql --no-publish -j 2 --runs 3 --threshold 1.0 --ablation none --scaffold --allow-tools Bash
```

Notes:

- `--ablation none` runs one arm. Under the default two-arm run, every `tool_used: Skill` grader is an indicator and is not part of the score, so the "skill fired" check would not count toward the threshold.
- Use `--case <glob>` to run one case.
- The first run in a directory asks to trust it. In a shell with no terminal, add `--trust-plugin`, only for this repo's own suite.
- A case may set only `EVAL_*` environment variables. A scaffold script cannot set `PGSERVICEFILE`, `PGPASSFILE` or `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` for the agent. It writes the temp service files at the default locations under the run's `HOME` (answer to open question 2 on the general spec).
- A case has one prompt. A reply that the case needs (approval, a setup confirmation) goes in that prompt.

## Cases

| Case | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `trigger-write-query` | A prompt that does not name the skill makes the skill fire, with no database connection and no formatter run (seam 4) |

## Fixture rules

- Every fixture is synthetic. No fixture copies code from the private inspiration repo, and no file names it.
- No fixture under the skill folder has a file named `test_*.py`. Fixture repos are JavaScript or TypeScript projects, and their own tests use `*.test.js` or `*.test.ts`. A `test_*.py` file under the skill folder would add a folder to the repo coverage test.
- Each fixture repo has its own `docs/agents/sql.md` when its case needs one.
- No case relies on this repo's own `docs/agents/` files.
